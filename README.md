# Nouk - the name finder

This app is for future parents to find a name for their baby.

**This app is still under development.**

The idea behind the app:
* Parents can add first names they like.
* By frequently rating the names the most loved names finally should get to the top of the list.
* Respecting the privacy of the parents.

Technology stack:
* Single Page App build with Angular
* Progressive Web App (PWA) to have an offline experience.
* All data should be stored offline with IndexedDB.

## Development

You need on your computer:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 12.x
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
